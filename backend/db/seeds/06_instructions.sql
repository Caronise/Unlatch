Step 1
Park the Dodge Caliber on a level and stable surface.

Step 2
Raise the front of the vehicle with the jack. Make sure there is sufficient room to work comfortably beneath the vehicle.

Step 3
Lower the Caliber frame onto the jack stands. Make sure the jack stands are sitting squarely on the ground.

Step 4
Position the oil drip pan under the oil drain plug located on the bottom of the engine.

Step 5
Loosen and remove the drain plug carefully. The oil will begin to flow before the plug is completely removed.

Step 6
Allow the oil to drain for several minutes. Do not reinstall the drain plug until the flow has stopped completely.

Step 7
Reinstall the drain plug and tighten with the adjustable wrench.

Step 8
Move the drain pan under the oil filter.

Step 9
Remove the filter with the oil filter wrench. The used filter is full of dirty oil, so handle it with care.

Step 10
Install the new filter by hand and tighten it about a 1/4 turn with the filter wrench.

Step 11
Move the drain pan, the old filter and the tools from under the Caliber. Raise the car above the jack stands. Remove the stands.

Step 12
Lower the Dodge Caliber back to the ground using the jack. Remove and store away the jack.

Step 13
Raise the vehicle hood and prop it open. Remove the oil fill cover from the middle of the engine compartment.

Step 14
Pour clean oil into the engine using the funnel.

Step 15
Run the engine for several minutes. Check the oil level using the dipstick. Add more oil as needed.

Dispose of the used oil and filter in accordance with applicable laws and ordinances.');

Step 1
Park the Dodge Caliber in a location that allows you to safely work on both sides of the vehicle. Put the transmission in "park" and apply the parking brake.

Step 2
Loosen the lug nuts on the wheels with the lug wrench.

Step 3
Lift the Dodge with the jack and place jack stands beneath the frame to support the vehicle during the brake pad replacement.

Step 4
Remove the lug nuts and pull the wheels from the wheel bolts of the Caliber.

Step 5
Remove the two caliper slide bolts with a 5/8-inch hex socket and ratchet. Pull the caliper from the caliper bridge (fitted around the rotor).

Step 6
Slide the worn brake pads from the two sides of the caliper.

Step 7
Place the C-clamp onto the side of the caliper and the caliper piston. Screw the C-clamp to force the piston into the side of the caliper. Remove the C-clamp from the caliper once the piston is fully opened.

Step 8
Clean the inside walls of the caliper with a wire brush. Apply a thin layer of brake grease onto the inner walls of the caliper, particularly at the point that the piston protrudes from the caliper wall.

Step 9
Slide the new brake pads onto the walls of the caliper. The brake pads connect to the caliper by thin metal clips on the backs of the brake pads.

Step 10
Place the caliper, with new brake pads installed, onto the caliper bridge. Replace the caliper slide bolts and screw them in with the 5/8-inch hex socket and ratchet.

Step 11
Place the wheel onto the wheel bolts and screw on the lug nuts by hand.

Step 12
Lift the vehicle with a lifting jack to remove the jack stands and lower the Caliber to the ground.

Step 13
Tighten the lug nuts with the lug wrench.

Step 14
Open the hood of the Dodge and remove the cap to the master cylinder. The master cylinder is on the driver side of the vehicle, near the windshield.

Step 15
Press the brake pedal three times and hold it in the depressed position for 10 seconds.

Fill the master cylinder with DOT-3 brake fluid. Replace the master cylinder cap and close the hood.

Step 1: Raise the front of the vehicle using ramps or a jack and jack stands. NEVER go underneath a vehicle supported only by a jack.

Step 2: Locate the drain plug underneath the vehicle and place your oil catch pan underneath it. Cover the surrounding area in newspaper or garbage bags to avoid spills on your garage floor.

Step 3:Remove the drain plug using a wrench and a 19mm socket. Use your hand to unscrew the bolt once it has been loosened with a wrench. If your vehicle has recently been driven be careful not to burn yourself as the oil will be extremely hot.

Step 4: Allow the oil to completely drain out into the catch pan. If the engine is cold, this may take a little longer.

Step 5: Open the hood and locate the oil filter towards the left side on the top of the engine bay. Use oil filter pliers to loosen and remove the old filter from the vehicle.

Step 6: Lubricate the rubber gasket on the new filter using your finger and a drop of new oil.

Step 7: Reinstall the new filter by screwing it clockwise into the housing. Hand tighten the filter only.

Step 8: Reinstall a new drain plug and washer

Step 9: Tighten the drain plug until snug using your 19mm socket and wrench. Do not over tighten as it may damage the threads in the oil pan and cause leaks.

Step 10: Add approximately 4.5L of new oil using your funnel to avoid spills. Lower the vehicle and start the engine for 1-2 minutes to allow oil to circulate through the engine.

Step 11: Remove the dipstick and add oil as necessary. Note the Max and Min reading on either side of the ribbed area of the dip stick. Oil levels should always be somewhere within the indented region. Add enough oil so that the level reads full on the dipstick (in this case 0.4L was added for a total of 4.9L).

Step 1: Jack Up Your Car And Remove The Wheel
Follow your car jacking instructions to lift one corner at a time. After removing your wheel, place it under the car in case the jack and/or jack stand fails.  

Step 2: Remove Brake Caliper Spring

Using a flat/slotted head screwdriver, wedge it between the caliper and the spring. Applying constant pressure, pull back until the spring releases. (Pro Tip: Place a rag over the spring once you are ready to release it. That way if it shoots out, the rag catches/dampens it rather than catching it with your face!)

Step 3: Remove Brake Caliper Bolts 

Using your 7MM Allen/Hex head socket, remove the brake caliper bolts. These are accessible behind the caliper, inside the wheel well. There are only two bolts and they slide into rubber sleeves. If the brakes have never been worked on, or you live in an area that salts the roads, there is a chance these bolts will be tough to remove. If that is the case, you can turn the wheels to give you more room to access them or even get a breaker bar in there. 

Step 4: Brake Caliper and Pad Removal

Now that you have removed the bolts that fasten the caliper to the bracket, you can slide the caliper off the rotor. Sometimes, the outside pad will just fall off, other times it takes a little coaxing to remove. The inner pad has to be removed from the caliper piston. It is affixed to the caliper piston using spring clips. You can usually remove it just by prying with your hands or a flat head screw driver if necessary. Now would be a good time to inspect your caliper piston for pitting if you live in a place that uses salt on the roads. 

**Once you remove your brake caliper, use a metal coat hanger or spare wire to hang it up from underneath the car. This keeps stress off your brake lines. **

Step 5: Remove The Caliper Hold Down Bracket

From behind the rotor (inside the wheel well), use a 21MM socket to remove two bolts that fasten the caliper hold down bracket. And once again, these are susceptible to being quite difficult to remove. It might be beneficial to use spray penetrant about an hour before attempting to remove these bolts. 

Step 6: Remove Rotor Set Screw

Using a T30 Torx, remove the set screw on the face of the rotor. Spray penetrant can be handy once again, depending on the last service. 

Step 7: Remove Brake Rotor and Clean Hub

The old rotor might take gentle persuasion to remove from the hub; surface corrosion holds them in place fairly well sometimes. If they have ever been replaced before, some mechanics use anti-seize between the surfaces to prevent this from happening in the future. 

Once the rotor is removed, use your libation of choice to clean the hub. Brake clean and a stiff wire brush is usually enough to do the job. 

Step 8: Clean and Install New Brake Rotor

Your new brake rotors come looking clean and brand new; a far cry from what you just took off your car. Most times however, there is shipping grease protecting them from corrosion while they sit on warehouse shelves. Using a clean rag and a healthy dose of brake clean, clean the new rotors thoroughly. Once clean, use the new T30 Torx screw to affix your new rotor to your cleaned hub. I personally like to add a touch of anti-seize to the face of the hub before installation. 

Step 9: Reinstall Caliper Hold Down Bracket

Like everything else, make sure your hold down bracket is clean of rust and debris. Using your 21MM socket, reinstall the caliper hold down bracket from inside the wheel well. I suggest using a torque wrench at this point to torque these bolts to manufacture spec (140 lbs-ft).

Step 10: Compress Caliper Piston

Take your caliper compressor and fit it between the front of the brake caliper and the piston. As you squeeze, this will push the piston back into the cylinder. If you plan on doing many brake jobs yourself, I would highly recommend purchasing the compressor. Using c-clamps and other makeshift tools can work, but after doing two cars worth of brakes, you will be wishing you purchased one from the beginning. 

Make sure you compress it entirely. If you do not, there is a good chance it will not clear with the pads on.

Step 11: Inspect, Clean, and Lubricate Caliper Slide Bolts

The slide bolts that hold your caliper to the bracket allow your caliper to self-locate. It is crucial for these bolts to be clean and greased. Inspect the bolts for any discrepancies, clean well with brake clean, and apply new grease. White Lithium grease works, as well as silicone or PTFE based grease. Be careful when using other types of grease as it can break down the rubber boots. Slide the bolts into the rubber boots so they are ready for caliper re-installation. 


Step 12: Brake Pad Installation

Installation of your new pads is straight forward. Apply a healthy film of brake pad grease to the BACK SIDE of the new pads. This grease helps prevent your new brakes from squeaking. One pad you will latch onto the brake caliper bracket, while the other pad gets clipped into the brake caliper piston. It might take a bit of pressure to get it to pop in, but it will go. If you accidentally had grease get on the faces of the pads, a quick rub with a rag soaked in brake clean will do the trick removing it. 

Step 13: Brake Caliper Installation

Installation is the reverse of the disassembly. From inside the wheel well, use a 7MM allen/hex socket to tighten the two caliper slide bolts. Manufacture torque spec on these slide bolts is 18 lbs-ft. 

Step 14: Install Brake Pad Anti-Rattle Springs

Some people run without them for track use, but I feel they are a must for daily drivers. Anti-Rattle springs do just as implied. Without this spring clip, the pads rattle so loudly it sounds as if you are carrying loose items in the trunk. To install, hook the two ends into the brake pad. Then, use your flat/slot head screwdriver to pry the back of the clip away until the ends of the spring go over the bracket. 

Step 15: Reinstall Wheel, Lower your Car, and Pump your Brakes

At this point, you are almost done. You can reinstall your wheel (making sure to torque it to spec). Get ready to lower your car by making sure any tools are out from underneath and your jack stands are clear. Once you know this, lower it to the ground. Start it up and pump the brakes until you feel them go hard. If they do, you are all set.

Step-1: Raise the vehicle using a lift, jack stands, etc. Make sure that if you use jack stands the vehicle is raised on jack points, and it is stable.

Step-2: Remove the aerodynamic/skid pad underneath the engine. I used a screwdriver. I forgot to count how many screws there are, but they will be easy to find. They are easy to see.

Step-3: Use your ratchet and 17mm socket to remove the drain plug and drain the old oil.
Replace the drain plug, and drain plug gasket, after the old oil has drained, and lower the vehicle.

Step-4: Once the vehicle has been lowered, open the hood and locate the oil cap and several 10mm bolts detailed in the photos. Remove these bolts.
One has to remove these bolts in order to free these intake pieces (pictured below) to gain access to the oil filter. Remove these intake pieces.

Step-5: Once the intake pieces have been removed, the oil filter will be visible. Use a 36mm socket to remove the top cap of the oil filter housing, and take out the old filter and filter gasket.

Step-6: Once the oil filter cap has been removed, and the oil filter and gasket have been removed, replace with new filter and gasket. Be sure to work the gasket above the threads on the cap to ensure to tight seal.

Step-7: Install new filter and re-install filter cap. Then re-install intake pieces. Now pour in the new oil.
Re-install oil cap when oil is in. Briefly start the engine to distribute the oil, and check the oil level/add oil thereafter, until satisfied with oil level.

Step 1. Jack your car up and make sure that it is securely supported.

Step 2. Remove the front wheel.

Step 3. With a 12mm spanner remove the lower bolt securing the caliper. (If it rotate freely you might need to secure the inner part with a 15mm spanner, in my case it wasn’t needed.)

Step 4. Push the caliper up, this will allow you to remove and replace the brake pads.

Step 5. Wind the piston in to get space to fit the new pads.

Step 6. Insert the new brake pads in place. Be sure that you install the one with the little metalic bit onto the rear, with the metalic bit on the lower side.

Step 7. Re-install the caliper lower bolt, securely tighten (If it rotate freely you might need to secure the inner part with a 15mm spanner, in my case it wasn’t needed).

Re-install the wheel back on and you’re done!
