--VW front brake pads and rotors 
INSERT INTO instructions (project_id, steps)
VALUES ('4', 'Follow your car jacking instructions to lift one corner at a time. After removing your wheel, place it under the car in case the jack and/or jack stand fails.');

INSERT INTO instructions (project_id, steps)
VALUES ('4', 'Using a flat/slotted head screwdriver, wedge it between the caliper and the spring. Applying constant pressure, pull back until the spring releases. (Pro Tip: Place a rag over the spring once you are ready to release it. That way if it shoots out, the rag catches/dampens it rather than catching it with your face!)');

INSERT INTO instructions (project_id, steps)
VALUES ('4', 'Using your 7MM Allen/Hex head socket, remove the brake caliper bolts. These are accessible behind the caliper, inside the wheel well. There are only two bolts and they slide into rubber sleeves. If the brakes have never been worked on, or you live in an area that salts the roads, there is a chance these bolts will be tough to remove. If that is the case, you can turn the wheels to give you more room to access them or even get a breaker bar in there.');

INSERT INTO instructions (project_id, steps)
VALUES ('4', 'Now that you have removed the bolts that fasten the caliper to the bracket, you can slide the caliper off the rotor. Sometimes, the outside pad will just fall off, other times it takes a little coaxing to remove. The inner pad has to be removed from the caliper piston. It is affixed to the caliper piston using spring clips. You can usually remove it just by prying with your hands or a flat head screw driver if necessary. Now would be a good time to inspect your caliper piston for pitting if you live in a place that uses salt on the roads.');

INSERT INTO instructions (project_id, steps)
VALUES ('4', 'Once you remove your brake caliper, use a metal coat hanger or spare wire to hang it up from underneath the car. This keeps stress off your brake lines.');

INSERT INTO instructions (project_id, steps)
VALUES ('4', 'From behind the rotor (inside the wheel well), use a 21MM socket to remove two bolts that fasten the caliper hold down bracket. And once again, these are susceptible to being quite difficult to remove. It might be beneficial to use spray penetrant about an hour before attempting to remove these bolts.');

INSERT INTO instructions (project_id, steps)
VALUES ('4', 'Using a T30 Torx, remove the set screw on the face of the rotor. Spray penetrant can be handy once again, depending on the last service. ');

INSERT INTO instructions (project_id, steps)
VALUES ('4', 'The old rotor might take gentle persuasion to remove from the hub; surface corrosion holds them in place fairly well sometimes. If they have ever been replaced before, some mechanics use anti-seize between the surfaces to prevent this from happening in the future. Clean the hub, break clean and a stiff wire brush is usually enough to do the job.');

INSERT INTO instructions (project_id, steps)
VALUES ('4', 'Your new brake rotors come looking clean and brand new; a far cry from what you just took off your car. Most times however, there is shipping grease protecting them from corrosion while they sit on warehouse shelves. Using a clean rag and a healthy dose of brake clean, clean the new rotors thoroughly. Once clean, use the new T30 Torx screw to affix your new rotor to your cleaned hub. I personally like to add a touch of anti-seize to the face of the hub before installation.');

INSERT INTO instructions (project_id, steps)
VALUES ('4', 'Like everything else, make sure your hold down bracket is clean of rust and debris. Using your 21MM socket, reinstall the caliper hold down bracket from inside the wheel well. I suggest using a torque wrench at this point to torque these bolts to manufacture spec (140 lbs-ft).');

INSERT INTO instructions (project_id, steps)
VALUES ('4', 'Take your caliper compressor and fit it between the front of the brake caliper and the piston. As you squeeze, this will push the piston back into the cylinder. If you plan on doing many brake jobs yourself, I would highly recommend purchasing the compressor. Using c-clamps and other makeshift tools can work, but after doing two cars worth of brakes, you will be wishing you purchased one from the beginning. Make sure you compress it entirely, if you do not, there is a good chance it will not clear with the pads on.');

INSERT INTO instructions (project_id, steps)
VALUES ('4', 'The slide bolts that hold your caliper to the bracket allow your caliper to self-locate. It is crucial for these bolts to be clean and greased. Inspect the bolts for any discrepancies, clean well with brake clean, and apply new grease. White Lithium grease works, as well as silicone or PTFE based grease. Be careful when using other types of grease as it can break down the rubber boots. Slide the bolts into the rubber boots so they are ready for caliper re-installation.');

INSERT INTO instructions (project_id, steps)
VALUES ('4', 'Installation of your new pads is straight forward. Apply a healthy film of brake pad grease to the BACK SIDE of the new pads. This grease helps prevent your new brakes from squeaking. One pad you will latch onto the brake caliper bracket, while the other pad gets clipped into the brake caliper piston. It might take a bit of pressure to get it to pop in, but it will go. If you accidentally had grease get on the faces of the pads, a quick rub with a rag soaked in brake clean will do the trick removing it.');

INSERT INTO instructions (project_id, steps)
VALUES ('4', 'Installation is the reverse of the disassembly. From inside the wheel well, use a 7MM allen/hex socket to tighten the two caliper slide bolts. Manufacture torque spec on these slide bolts is 18 lbs-ft.');

INSERT INTO instructions (project_id, steps)
VALUES ('4', 'Some people run without them for track use, but I feel they are a must for daily drivers. Anti-Rattle springs do just as implied. Without this spring clip, the pads rattle so loudly it sounds as if you are carrying loose items in the trunk. To install, hook the two ends into the brake pad. Then, use your flat/slot head screwdriver to pry the back of the clip away until the ends of the spring go over the bracket.');

INSERT INTO instructions (project_id, steps)
VALUES ('4', 'At this point, you are almost done. You can reinstall your wheel (making sure to torque it to spec). Get ready to lower your car by making sure any tools are out from underneath and your jack stands are clear. Once you know this, lower it to the ground. Start it up and pump the brakes until you feel them go hard. If they do, you are all set.');

INSERT INTO instructions (project_id, steps)
VALUES ('5', 'Raise the vehicle using a lift, jack stands, etc. Make sure that if you use jack stands the vehicle is raised on jack points, and it is stable.');

INSERT INTO instructions (project_id, steps)
VALUES ('5', 'Remove the aerodynamic/skid pad underneath the engine. I used a screwdriver. I forgot to count how many screws there are, but they will be easy to find. They are easy to see.');

INSERT INTO instructions (project_id, steps)
VALUES ('5', 'Use your ratchet and 17mm socket to remove the drain plug and drain the old oil. Replace the drain plug, and drain plug gasket, after the old oil has drained, and lower the vehicle.');

INSERT INTO instructions (project_id, steps)
VALUES ('5', 'Once the vehicle has been lowered, open the hood and locate the oil cap and several 10mm bolts detailed in the photos. Remove these bolts. One has to remove these bolts in order to free these intake pieces (pictured below) to gain access to the oil filter. Remove these intake pieces.
');

INSERT INTO instructions (project_id, steps)
VALUES ('5', 'Once the intake pieces have been removed, the oil filter will be visible. Use a 36mm socket to remove the top cap of the oil filter housing, and take out the old filter and filter gasket.');

INSERT INTO instructions (project_id, steps)
VALUES ('5', 'Once the oil filter cap has been removed, and the oil filter and gasket have been removed, replace with new filter and gasket. Be sure to work the gasket above the threads on the cap to ensure to tight seal.');

INSERT INTO instructions (project_id, steps)
VALUES ('5', 'Install new filter and re-install filter cap. Then re-install intake pieces. Now pour in the new oil. Re-install oil cap when oil is in. Briefly start the engine to distribute the oil, and check the oil level/add oil thereafter, until satisfied with oil level.');

INSERT INTO instructions (project_id, steps)
VALUES ('6', 'With a 12mm spanner remove the lower bolt securing the caliper. (If it rotate freely you might need to secure the inner part with a 15mm spanner, in my case it wasn’t needed.)');

INSERT INTO instructions (project_id, steps)
